SQRT(Elevation Gain(in feet) x 2 x distance (in miles))
- less than 50 : Easiest (1.5 miles per hour)
- 50 ~ 100 : Moderate (1.4 miles per hour)
- 100 ~ 150 : Moderately Strenuous (1.3 mph)
- 150 ~ 200 : Strenuous (1.2 mph)
- 200 ~ : Very Strenuous (1.2 mph)


Our goal is to determine the difficulty of each trail at MacLeish based on its length and elevation, and to be able to classify trails based on difficulty so that visitors can better decide which trail they would like to take. ^[https://github.com/niannucci/MP3-Macleish]
